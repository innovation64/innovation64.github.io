# Graph Augmentation of GNN

- Graph Feature augmentation
- Graph Structure augmentation

- Certain structures are hard to learn by GNN
- Other commonly used augmented features:
  - Node degree
  - Clustering  coefficient
  - PageRank
  - Centrality

## Add Virtual Nodes/Edges 
- Motibation : Augment sparse graphs
  - Add virtual edges 
  - Add virtual nodes
  - Node Neighborhood Sampling

# Training Graph Neutal Networks
- GNN Training Pipeline
- Prediction Heads :
  - Node-level
  - Edge-level
## Issue of Global Pooling
Global pooling over a (large) graph will lose information

## Hierarchical Global Pooling
A solution : Let's aggregate all the node embeddings hierarchically

## Regression Loss
MSE

## Dataset Split : Fixed / Random Split
- Fixed split : We will split our dataset once
- A concern : sometimes we cannot guarantee that the test set will really be held out
- Random split : we will randomly split our dataset into training / validation / test
- we report average performance over different random seeds

## Example: Link prediction
Goal of link prediction: predict missing edges
