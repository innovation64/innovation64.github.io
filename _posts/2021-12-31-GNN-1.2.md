- Link-level prediction
- Graph-level prediction

## This Lecture :feature Design
Goal : Make predictions for a set of objects
Design choices:
- Features:d-dimensional  vectors
- Objects: Nodes,edges,sets of nodes,entire graphs
- Objective function
what task are we aiming to solve
## Node-level Features:Overview
Goal:Characterize the structure and position of a node in the network:
- Node degree
- Node centrality
- Clustering coefficient
- Graphlets

Eigenvector centrality:

## Graphlets
- GDV counts graphlets
- Degree counts edges
- Clustering coefficient counts triangles

## Obtain node feature:
- importance-based features:
    - Node degree
    - Different node centrality measures
- Structure-based features:
    - Node degree
    - Clustering coefficient
    - Graphlet count vector

# Traditional Feature-based Methods --Link

Recap

## Two formulations of the link prediction task:
- Links missing at random:
- Link over time:

## Methodology

Summary
- Distance-based features:
- Local neighborhood overlap
- Global neighborhood overlap

# Traditional Feature-based Methods --Graph
## Background:kernel Methods
Idea: Design Kernels instead of feature vectors
![](https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/31/7J1Yp25bSO6Igkq.png)

## Graph Kernels: Measure similarity between two graphsï¼š
- Graphlet Kernel
- Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel
- Others
    - Random-walk kernel
    - Shortest-path graph kernel
    - etc...

Goal: Design graph feature vector 
Key idea: Bag-of-Words(BoW) for a graph

Both Graphlet Kernel and weisfeiler-Lehman(WL) kernel use Bag-of * representation of graph , where * is more sophisticated than node degrees!

## Graphlet Features
key idea:Count the number of different graphlets in a graph.

Limitations:

Goal : design an efficient graph feature descriptor fa(G)

Idea: Use neighborhood structure to iteratively enrich node vocabulary
    - generalized version of Bag of node degrees
- Algorithm to achieve this:
    Color refinement

### Color Refinement
- Given: A graph G with a set of nodes V.
