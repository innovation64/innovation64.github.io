# Prompt 手册(openai官方系列)
这里的 prompt是针对 GPT4 才能达到良好效果，**示例采用英文是因为模型问题，换成中文不保证能达到同样的效果。**
## 一，六步获得更好的结果
### 给予清楚的命令
>如果觉得输出太长，让他给出简短的答案，如果给出的答案太简单，让他输出专家级别的回答，如果你不喜欢输出格式，给你喜欢的格式，别让模型天天猜你你想要啥，多给约束

策略：
- 给予细节
- 采用角色
- 清楚划分输入的不同部分
- 指定完成任务需要步骤
- 提供列子
- 指定输出长度

### 提供参考文本
> LLM有幻觉问题，尤其针对复杂问题或者需要引用或 Urls 

策略：
- 用参考文本回答
- 同时引用参考文本内容

### 分解复杂任务
> 把复杂任务分解成多个简单任务，让模型输出结果，然后把结果拼接起来(工作流)

策略：
- 根据意图分类找到最相关的指令
- 长对话需要总结或过滤之前的内容
- 总结长文档并递归重构

### 给模型时间去思考
>COT

策略：
- 在结论前指导
- 在内部隐藏推理过程
- 询问是否错过或者忽视了之前的某些细节

### 使用额外的工具
> 通过把模型的输出和外部工具连接获得更好的效果。比如 RAG 

策略：
- 用基于嵌入的搜索来高效知识检索
- 调用额外的API或代码计算加强
- 给予模型权限去控制特殊功能函数

### 系统的测试
> 为了防止prompt只针对特定例子有良好效果需要制作通用测试

策略：
- 评估模型对标参考答案


## 详细示例

### 给予清楚的命令

#### 1. 给定细节

You will be provided with customer service inquiries that require troubleshooting in a technical support context. Help the user by:

- Ask them to check that all cables to/from the router are connected. Note that it is common for cables to come loose over time.
- If all cables are connected and the issue persists, ask them which router model they are using
- Now you will advise them how to restart their device:
-- If the model number is MTD-327J, advise them to push the red button and hold it for 5 seconds, then wait 5 minutes before testing the connection.
-- If the model number is MTD-327S, advise them to unplug and replug it, then wait 5 minutes before testing the connection.
- If the customer's issue persists after restarting the device and waiting 5 minutes, connect them to IT support by outputting {"IT support requested"}.
- If the user starts asking questions that are unrelated to this topic then confirm if they would like to end the current chat about troubleshooting and classify their request according to the following scheme:

<insert primary/secondary classification scheme from above here>
</td>
  </tr>

以评估学生数学解法对错为例

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SYSTEM （系统）</th>
    <td>



Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.
</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>USER （用户）</th>
    <td>

Problem Statement: I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials.
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution: Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Assistant（辅助）</th>
    <td>



The student's solution is correct.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

可以看到解法错误，通过下面方式先生成自己的解法

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SYSTEM （系统）</th>
    <td>




First work out your own solution to the problem. Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.
</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>USER （用户）</th>
    <td>

Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x = 360x + 100,000

The student's solution is incorrect. They made an error in the maintenance cost calculation, using 100x instead of 10x. The correct total cost for the first year of operations is 360x + 100,000.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### 2. 隐藏中间结果


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SYSTEM （系统）</th>
    <td>


Follow these steps to answer the user queries.

Step 1 - First work out your own solution to the problem. Don't rely on the student's solution since it may be incorrect. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes (""").

Step 2 - Compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes (""").

Step 3 - If the student made a mistake, determine what hint you could give the student without giving away the answer. Enclose all your work for this step within triple quotes (""").

Step 4 - If the student made a mistake, provide the hint from the previous step to the student (outside of triple quotes). Instead of writing "Step 4 - ..." write "Hint:".
</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>USER （用户）</th>
    <td>




Problem Statement: < insert problem statement>

Student Solution: < insert student solution>

</td>
  </tr>
</table>

或者通过一系列询问达到隐藏效果

#### 3.询问遗忘或丢失

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SYSTEM （系统）</th>
    <td>



You will be provided with a document delimited by triple quotes. Your task is to select excerpts which pertain to the following question: "What significant paradigm shifts have occurred in the history of artificial intelligence."

Ensure that excerpts contain all relevant context needed to interpret them - in other words don't extract small snippets that are missing important context. Provide output in JSON format as follows:

[{"excerpt": "..."},
...
{"excerpt": "..."}]
</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>USER （用户）</th>
    <td>


"""< insert document here>"""</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Assistant（辅助）</th>
    <td>


[{"excerpt": "the model writes an excerpt here"},
...
{"excerpt": "the model writes another excerpt here"}]</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>USER （用户）</th>
    <td>


Are there more relevant excerpts? Take care not to repeat excerpts. Also ensure that excerpts contain all relevant context needed to interpret them - in other words don't extract small snippets that are missing important context.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 使用工具
#### 1.文本嵌入向量来高效检索
#### 2.执行代码或者调用API

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SYSTEM （系统）</th>
    <td>



You can write and execute Python code by enclosing it in triple backticks, e.g. ```code goes here```. Use this to perform calculations.
</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>USER （用户）</th>
    <td>


Find all real-valued roots of the following polynomial: 3*x**5 - 5*x**4 - 3*x**3 - 7*x - 10.

</td>
  </tr>
</table>

或者


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SYSTEM （系统）</th>
    <td>

    You can write and execute Python code by enclosing it in triple backticks. Also note that you have access to the following module to help users send messages to their friends:

    ```python
    import message
    message.write(to="John", message="Hey, want to meetup after work?")
    ```
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


注意安全性问题

#### 3. 给予模型权限

### 系统测试

好的评估
- 现实使用的代表（或至少多样化）

- 包含许多具有更大统计能力的测试用例（有关指南，请参见下表）

- 易于自动或重复

|检测不同|95%的置信区间的采样大小|
|--|--|
|30%|-10|
|10%|-100|
|3%|-1000|
|1%|-10000|

#### 1.带参考答案评估

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SYSTEM （系统）</th>
    <td>

    You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes that is supposed to be the answer to a question. Check if the following pieces of information are directly contained in the answer:

    - Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.
    - The date Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon was July 21, 1969.

    For each of these points perform the following steps:

    1 - Restate the point.
    2 - Provide a citation from the answer which is closest to this point.
    3 - Consider if someone reading the citation who doesn't know the topic could directly infer the point. Explain why or why not before making up your mind.
    4 - Write "yes" if the answer to 3 was yes, otherwise write "no".

    Finally, provide a count of how many "yes" answers there are. Provide this count as {"count": <insert count here>}.
