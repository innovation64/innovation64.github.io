# PageRank : How to solve
- Given a graph with n nodes,we use an iterative procedure
    - Assign each node an initial page rank 
    -Repeat until convergence ()

- Power Iteration Method
    -Given a web graph with N nodes,where the nodes are pages and edges are hyperlinks.
    - Power iteration:a simple iterative scheme

- Problem
    - Some pages are dead ends
    - Spider traps

- Solution to Spider Traps
    - Solution for spider traps: At each time step,the random surfer has two options
        - with prob.a ï¼Œfollow a link at random 
        - with prob.1-a, jump to a random page
        - Common values for a are in the range 0.8 to 0.9
    - Surfer will teleport out of spider trap within a few time steps

- Why teleports Solve the problem
Why are dead-ends and spider traps a problem and why do teleports solve the problem?
    -Spider-trap are not a problem ,but with traps PageRank scores are not what we want
        - Solution : Never get stuck in a spider trap by teleporting out of it in a finite number of steps.
    - Dead-ends are a problem 
        - The matrix is not column stochastic so our initial assumptions are not met
        - Solution : Make matrix column stochastic by always teleporting when there is nowhere else to go 

- Solution : Random Teleports

# Random Walk with Restarts and Personalized PageRank

- PageRank:
    - Ranks nodes by "importance"
    - Teleports with uniform  probability to any node in the network  
- Personalized PageRank:
    - Ranks proximity of nodes to the teleport nodes S
- Proximity on graphs:
    - Q: What is most related item to Item Q?
    - Random Walks with Restars
        -Teleport back to the starting nodes: S = {Q}

- Idea : Random Walks
    - Idea
        - Every node has some importance
        - Importance gets evenly split among all edges and pushed to the neighbors
    - Given a set of QUERY_NODES ,we simulate a random walk:
        - Make a step to a random neighbor and record the visit 
        - With probability ALPHA, restart the walk at one of QUERY_NODES
        - The nodes with the highest visit count have highest proximity to the QUERY_NODES
