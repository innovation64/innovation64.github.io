# How Expressive are Graph Neural Networks?
## Idea : Aggregate Neighbors
## Local Neighborhood Structures
- To generate a node embedding , GNNs use a computational graph corresponding to a subtree rooted around each node.

# Design the most powerfull GNNs
## Expressive Power of GNNs
- Key observation: Expressive power of GNNs can be characterized by that of neighbor aggregation functions they use.
