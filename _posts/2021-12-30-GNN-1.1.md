# GNN 1.1 Why Graphs
## Many Types of Data are Graphs
- Knowledge Graphs
- Regulatory Networks
- Scene Graphs
- Code Graphs 
- Molecules
- 3D shapes

## Graphs
- Information / Knowledge
- Software
- Similarity networks
- Relational structures

## topic
- Traditional methods: Graphlets , Graph Kernels
- Methods for node embeddings : DeepWalk , Node2Vec
- Graph Neural Networks: GCN , GraphSAGE , GAT ,Theory of GNNs
- Knowledge graphs and reasoning : TransE , BetaE
- Deep generative models for graphs
- Applications to Biomedicine , Science , Industry

# Applications of Graph ML
## Classic Graph ML task
- Node classification
- Link Prediction
- Graph classification
- Clustering
- Graph generation
- Graph evolution

# Choice of Graph Representation
## Components of a Network
- ObjectS: nodes , vertices   N
- Interactions: links , edges   E
- System: network , graph    G(N,E)
