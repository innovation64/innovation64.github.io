# Node Embeddings

```flow

start=>start: Input Graph
info=>operation: Structured Features
setCache=>operation: Learning Algorithm
end=>end: Prediction
start->info->setCache->end

```
Input Graph --> feature enginearing 
now we abrod that 
Automatically learn 

## Graph Representation Learning
Goal: Efficient task -independent feature learning for machine learning with graphs

## Why Embedding 
Taskï¼šmap nodes into an embedding space

## Setup

Shallow Encoding
encoder is just an embedding-lookup

## Framework Summary 
Encoder + Decoder Framework
    - Shallow encoder:embedding looup
    - Parameters to optimize: Z which contains node embeddings zu for all nodes u <V
  - Decoder : based on node similarity
  - Objective: maximize ZvT Zu for node pairs(u,v) that are similar

# Random walk Approaches for Node Embeddings
- Vector Zu:
- Probability P(v|Zu):
- softmax
- sigmoid

## Random Walk Embeddings

## Unsupervised Feature Learning
Intuition:
- Find embeddding of nodes in d-dimensional space that preserves similarity
idea:
- Learn node embedding such that nearby nodes are close together in the network
Given a node u , how do we define nearby nodes?

## Overview of node2vec
Goal:
Embed node with similar network neighborhoods close in the feature space
Key observation:
Flexible notion of network neighborhood Nr of node u leads to rich node embeddings.

# Embedding Entire Graph

## Summary
3 ideas to graph embeddings
Approach1: embed nodes and sum/avg them
Approcah2: Create super-node that spans the (sub) graph and then embed that node 
Approach3: Annoymous Walk embeddings
    Idea1: sample the anon.
    Idea2: Embed annoymous walks

## How to use embeddings zi of nodes:
- Clustering / community detection
- Node classification
- Link prediction
- Graph classification
